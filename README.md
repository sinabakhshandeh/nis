## What is pre-commit?
Pre-commit is built to solve hook issues. It is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any hook written in any language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to not require root access. If one of your developers doesnâ€™t have node installed but modifies a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles downloading and building node to run eslint without root.
